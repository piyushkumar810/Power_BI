1. Column Chart
--> A Column Chart displays data using vertical bars where the length of each bar represents the value.
--> Itâ€™s best when you want to compare individual categories.
    Example: If you have sales by product, each product will have a separate bar showing its sales.

ðŸ”¹ Use case:
Comparing sales of Product A, Product B, and Product C individually.

2. Stacked Column Chart
--> A Stacked Column Chart also uses vertical bars, but it divides each bar into segments (stacked portions) 
    to show sub-categories within a category.

Example: Sales by product (main category) further broken into regions (subcategories).

ðŸ”¹ Use case:
If you want to see total sales per product, and how much each region contributes inside that productâ€™s total.
