1. Column Chart
--> A Column Chart displays data using vertical bars where the length of each bar represents the value.
--> It’s best when you want to compare individual categories.
    Example: If you have sales by product, each product will have a separate bar showing its sales.

🔹 Use case:
Comparing sales of Product A, Product B, and Product C individually.

2. Stacked Column Chart
--> A Stacked Column Chart also uses vertical bars, but it divides each bar into segments (stacked portions) 
    to show sub-categories within a category.

Example: Sales by product (main category) further broken into regions (subcategories).

🔹 Use case:
If you want to see total sales per product, and how much each region contributes inside that product’s total.


3. Pie Chart 🥧

What it is: A circular chart divided into slices.
Purpose: Shows the proportion of each category relative to the whole (100%).
Best for: Simple part-to-whole comparisons with few categories (2–6).
Example: Market share of companies in a sector.

4. Donut Chart 🍩

What it is: Similar to a pie chart but with a hole in the middle.
Purpose: Same as a pie chart (part-to-whole comparison), but the hole allows you to Place a label/total in the center.
        Compare multiple donut charts side by side more easily.
Best for: Cleaner visuals than pie chart, and when you want to highlight totals in the middle.

5. Funnel Chart 🔻

What it is: A chart shaped like a funnel (wide at top, narrow at bottom).
Purpose: Shows data progression through stages and how values decrease step by step.
Best for: Visualizing conversion rates, drop-offs, or filtering processes.
Example: Sales pipeline → Leads → Opportunities → Customers.

6. Ribbon Chart 🎀

What it is: Similar to a stacked column chart but with ribbons connecting ranks across categories.
Purpose: Used to visualize rankings over time or across different categories.
Best for: Highlighting which category leads at a certain point and how rankings change.
Example: Which product was top-selling each month, and how the ranking of others changed.
